<!--
Here, the directive ng-model helps in achieving two-way data binding.

The value 'name' assigned to the ng-model directive is a variable of the $scope
service. It is defined in the js file.

Hence, anything that is typed in the text box gets available in the js file. So,
it can be modified into whatever manner we like.

Here, the text entered in the text box is changed into uppercase using the changeName()
function.
